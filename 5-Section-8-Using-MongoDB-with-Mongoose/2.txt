what is mongoDB?
*MongoDB is a database.
*Just like you save notes in a notebook ðŸ“’, MongoDB saves data in collections (like folders).
*Inside collections, data is stored as documents (like pages in the notebook).
*Each document is written in JSON-like format (keyâ€“value pairs).

what is mongoose?   
*Mongoose is a tool (a library for Node.js) that helps you work with MongoDB easily.
*Without Mongoose, youâ€™d have to write a lot of complex MongoDB code.
*With Mongoose, you can:
   *Create a Schema (like a blueprint of your data)
   *Validate data (make sure only correct data is saved)
    *Easily connect, save, update, and delete data

In short:
MongoDB = Database where data is stored.
Mongoose = Helper/Translator that makes talking to MongoDB in Node.js much easier.
